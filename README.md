# Muneeb Shahid

I am a Full Stack Engineer, currently working on digitizing the clinical trials process for Alzheimer's Therapeutic Research. Over the past three years, I have been engineering digital health applications and before that, I was developing FinTech products.

I enjoy working on creative ideas and challenging projects that aim to create a positive impact on people's lives. This motivates me to employ and improve my communication, technical and analytical skills.

Providing complete software engineering services from requirements analysis to production is my area of expertise. I have used various tools and technologies throughout my career. 
Currently, I am using Amazon Web Services, Django, Django REST framework, and PostgreSQL for backend infrastructure (ETL pipelines, APIs, Database, DevOps) development and React for the development of interactive graphical user interfaces.
